These scripts generate icons, preview images and full-scale PNG images for posters, as well as an HTML index document. They require the following setup:
 1. A CSV file "posterList.csv", which should contain the columns "Poster number", "Presenter", and "Poster title".
 2. A directory "raw" which should contain the raw poster images (in any image fformat, with files according to <lastname>_<firstname>.* . (For example weile_jochen.png)

The scripts also require a current installation of R and imagemagick.
